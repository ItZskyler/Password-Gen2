# Password-Gen2
Made in java, so its a .jar file
Maybe the PassGenAdvanced - final.jar won't run then you just need to make a new project in eclipse make a name for the project make a package called Test4 in src then make 2 files one called PassGen(.java) and Test4(.java) paste the PassGen in the PassGen file(duh)
and the Test4(.java) in the eclipse file too then export it as an runnable .jar file(make sure to have jre and jdk installed idk wich is needed) then a window will pop up (the login) the name you can use is dab(idk why) and the password is big(lol)
